# Changelog

Chronological log of notable changes to the project. Newest first.
This is a human-curated log — not a mirror of `git log`.

## 2026-07-25

- **Released into the public domain (Unlicense)** — the starter now ships a root
  `LICENSE.md` carrying the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) and declares
  `"license": "Unlicense"` in `package.json`. Anyone may copy, modify, sell, or
  redistribute it with **no attribution requirement and no copyright retained** —
  the intent being that projects built from this starter can absorb it wholesale
  without carrying a notice. Briefly authored as MIT in the same session and
  changed before any release; the MIT attribution clause was the specific thing
  being dropped, so a recognized no-attribution licence was chosen over an
  edited MIT text. `"private": true` is unchanged, so npm publishing stays
  blocked regardless — the licence governs redistribution of the source, not
  registry availability.

## 2026-07-24

- **`optimize-3d-scene` hardened from its first field run** — the skill was run
  on a real raw-WebGL scene (no three.js, no scroll) and eight gaps came back,
  ranked by the time each cost. Fixed in `SKILL.md` and `references/patterns.md`:
  **§0** now ships a `getContext` hook so a non-three.js scene has counted
  equivalents of `renderer.info` (`draws` / `verts` / `links[]` timestamps /
  captured `attrs`) — previously §0 was unexecutable there — plus the
  *measurement environment* rules that invalidate everything if missed
  (production build only: dev's eager chunks fake a §1 failure and Strict Mode's
  double-mount fakes 2 listeners and a halved fps; kill the stale server;
  `waitUntil: "load"`, since `networkidle0` never fires against `next start`;
  SwiftShader is not a GPU, so only counted quantities transfer). **§3** now
  states that **§1 breaks it** — `dynamic(ssr: false)` pushes compilation past
  hydration, measured at 5.0 s against a loader lifting at 2.36 s — and gains a
  fifth stall cause (CPU decode/parse → **Worker**, 3.9 s measured) and the
  `as="fetch"` preload credentials trap (only `use-credentials` + `include`
  dedupes; the others silently download twice). **§5** admits `1000/30` measures
  ~26 fps given the ticker's `<=` throttle. **§7** requires a decile ordering
  check before truncating a baked point buffer (one was spatially sorted —
  truncating would have deleted half the subject). **§13** splits canvas `lvh`
  from content `dvh`. **§1**'s poster is rejustified — crawler screenshots and
  the no-WebGL fallback, not layout stability — with two crops and the
  `headers()` → static-prerender (`○`→`ƒ`) trade-off named. Unchanged on
  purpose: the cheapest-first order, the canonical-file table, and "port, don't
  invent". ADR: [[decisions-log]] ADR-0017.
- **`optimize-3d-scene` skill registered in the vault** — the new skill at
  `.claude/skills/optimize-3d-scene/` is now a first-class part of the workflow
  set, documented in [[optimize-3d-scene]] and linked from the
  [[README|Map of Content]] and [[ai-agent-guide]].
  **Routing rule (AGENTS.md hard rule #11):**
  a performance / jank / pre-ship request on a project that renders a three.js
  or WebGL scene must invoke the skill and follow its fourteen-step order — no
  improvised fix list. The vault note also maps the skill's canonical patterns
  onto primitives the starter *already* ships, so nothing gets duplicated:
  `subscribeToTicker` (`src/lib/animation/ticker.ts`, ADR-0009) is the one
  app-wide rAF loop the skill's §4/§5 ask for, `isBot()` (`src/utils/is-bot.ts`,
  ADR-0010) is the §1 bot path, the Lenis scroll store is the §9/§10 scroll
  source, `useDynamicInView` is the §4 visibility gate, and `lvh.ts` covers §13
  sizing. Only device tiering (§2) has no local equivalent. The starter itself
  carries **no `three` dependency** ([[tech-stack]] unchanged) — this applies to
  projects built from it. ADR: [[decisions-log]] ADR-0016.
- **Fixed a broken path inside the skill** — its closing "write it down" step
  pointed at `obsidian/Meta/changelog.md` / `decisions-log.md` (capital `M`, and
  an `open-questions.md` that does not exist here), so an agent following it
  would have written to a non-existent folder. Rewritten against this vault's
  actual `obsidian/meta/` layout.
- **`ai-agent-guide` gained a Skills section** — how skills are registered
  (drop in `.claude/skills/<name>/`, add a `workflows/` note, link from the MoC
  and the skills table, log in the changelog), so the next skill follows the
  same path.

## 2026-07-17

- **README — one-prompt quick start** — added a copy-paste **⚡ Start in one
  prompt** block at the top of the README: a single prompt that has Claude Code
  (or Cursor) clone the starter, detach it from this repo's git history, read the
  vault first, and run the default install. The manual [Getting started](../../README.md#getting-started)
  path stays below for anyone who prefers it.
- **Fixed: `cp .env.example .env` broke `/api/contact`** — surfaced by writing
  that step into the quick-start prompt. Copying the example leaves
  `CONTACT_ENDPOINT=` (blank), which reaches zod as `""`, and `""` is not
  `undefined` — so `z.url().optional()` rejected it. The route returned **HTTP
  400 `{"path":"CONTACT_ENDPOINT","message":"Invalid URL"}`**, misreporting a
  *server misconfiguration* as the caller's bad input. `src/env.ts` now routes
  optional URLs through an `optionalUrl()` helper that preprocesses `""` →
  `undefined`. Verified end-to-end: a valid POST now returns 200, and genuinely
  invalid payloads still return 400. Any new **optional** variable must use the
  same helper — see [[environment-variables]].
- **README — corrected clone URL & Node requirement** — step 1 pointed at
  `github.com/textura/next16-claude-starter` (wrong org — the repo is
  `textura-agency/…`), so the documented clone would 404. Also added the Node
  floor (**22.13+**; 20.19+ works, 24 LTS recommended) — below it `yarn install`
  fails outright on `eslint-visitor-keys` — and the missing
  `cp .env.example .env` step.
- **TextEngine alignment & clipping rules documented** — two failure modes that
  bite every TextEngine block, now written into [[text-engine]] (new *Alignment &
  line-height* section), [[text-engine-reference]], and AGENTS.md hard rule #3.
  **(1)** The container renders `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap`, so words are
  flex items and `text-align` cannot position them — a lone `text-center`
  silently does nothing. Always pair `text-*` with `justify-*` on the tag
  (`justify-between` is a trap: it spreads *words*, not lines). **(2)** `overflow`
  sets `overflow: hidden` on `inline-block` wrap layers whose height comes from
  `line-height`, so tight leading shaves descenders and accented caps — keep
  leading ≥ 1.1 via the new `leading-display` token, never `leading-none` with
  `overflow`, and watch for `text-5xl`+ which ship `line-height: 1`. Both fixes
  are **classes on the `TextEngine` tag** — no wrapper component, no helper to
  import. Verified against the `spring-text-engine@0.1.5` dist source.
- **Strict three-tier token naming convention** — tokens now follow a fixed,
  portable grammar so names are predictable across every project built from this
  starter: `--raw-<category>-<name>` primitives → `--<role>` semantic →
  `--<tw-namespace>-<role>: var(--<role>)` bindings in `@theme inline`. Only
  Tier 1 holds literals; Tier 2 names purpose and is the themeable layer.
  `globals.css` restructured accordingly — **no brand palette invented**, the
  convention is the deliverable. Two deviations from the reference article,
  verified by compiling a probe against `tailwindcss` v4.3.3: primitives are
  `--raw-*` and stay out of `@theme` (a `--color-*` entry would generate
  utilities and let markup skip the semantic tier), and **`--duration-*` is not a
  Tailwind v4 namespace** — `duration-fast` compiles to nothing, so durations
  stay Tier 2 and are used as `duration-[var(--duration-fast)]`. See
  [[decisions-log]] ADR-0015 and [[design-system]].
- **Narrow CSS-transition exception** — hard rule #1 no longer bans CSS
  transitions outright. CSS `transition-*` is allowed for simple discrete state
  changes only (hover/focus colour, opacity, border, small nudges), requiring
  token-backed timing (`duration-[var(--duration-fast)] ease-entrance`),
  `transition-*` only (`@keyframes` still banned), and utilities only. Everything
  scroll-driven, revealing, staggered, or layout-affecting stays spring-based.
  A hover colour fade no longer needs a client component wrapping `<Hover>`. See
  [[decisions-log]] ADR-0014, [[animation-system]], [[design-system]].
- **New tokens** — `--raw-color-white` / `--raw-color-neutral-100/900/950`,
  `--raw-duration-fast/normal`, `--duration-fast/normal`, `--leading-display`
  (1.1 — the TextEngine clip floor), `--ease-entrance`.
- **Build & lint verified clean** — `yarn lint` and `yarn build` both pass with 0
  errors and 0 warnings; no lint fixes were needed. Note: `yarn install` **fails
  on Node 20.17** (`eslint-visitor-keys` requires `^20.19 || ^22.13 || >=24`) —
  use Node ≥ 20.19; this repo was verified on 24.16.

## 2026-06-07

- **Fixed `<Inview>` standalone reveal + spring resize gating** — `<Inview>`
  never animated unless an external `trigger` ref was passed. The JSX `ref`
  callback wrote `inViewRef.current = node`, but that tuple slot is a *callback
  ref* (`setNode`), so the element was never observed and the `node` stayed
  `null`. Now calls `setInViewNode(node)`. This was also a build-breaking type
  error. Additionally, `<Inview>`, `<Spring>`, and `<Hover>` tracked `width` as a
  hook dependency but never passed it to `isMobileDisabled` — fixed by passing the
  tracked `width`, restoring resize re-evaluation and clearing the
  `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings. `yarn build` and `yarn lint` are now
  clean. See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0013 and [[components/animation-springs]].

## 2026-06-05

- **Home view emptied** — removed the animation showcase (`src/views/home-showcase.tsx`
  deleted) and reduced `HomeView` to an empty `<main>`. The home view is now the
  blank starting point for new work. Documented the convention — *if the project
  is empty and no other instructions are provided, start developing in the home
  view on route `/`* — in [[ai-agent-guide]] and [[new-page]].

## 2026-05-23

- **README — setup + Vercel deploy steps added** — *Getting started* expanded
  into a four-step flow (clone the template → delete bundled `.git` →
  initialise your own GitHub repo → install & run), with a macOS hint for
  revealing the hidden `.git` folder (`⇧ + ⌘ + .`). Added a *🚀 Deploy to
  Vercel* section covering the CLI flow (`vercel` / `vercel --prod`) and the
  dashboard import path, plus an `env pull` pointer to
  [[environment-variables]].
- **README rewritten to lead with the AI workflow** — root `README.md`
  reorganised so the AI usage guide is the first section: how the three
  `.claude/settings.json` hooks (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`)
  enforce the vault workflow automatically, how to write a good request
  against this convention layer, and a cost-expectations note recommending
  **Claude Max (5×)** as the minimum plan (the vault-fan-out + hook
  re-injection on every turn is token-intensive by design). Technical
  *Getting started* and the existing AI-agents entry-point pointer stay
  below.

## 2026-05-22

- **Styling-placement convention added** — to stop `globals.css` accumulating
  hundreds of component-specific classes, styling now follows a strict
  placement order: one-offs are Tailwind utilities, repeated patterns become
  **React components** (not `@layer components` classes), and `@layer
  components` is reserved strictly for pseudo-elements and third-party
  overrides. `globals.css` stays bounded — `@import`, tokens, base resets only.
  No CSS Modules. Codified in [[decisions-log]] ADR-0012; [[design-system]]
  (new *Where a style goes* section) and [[component-conventions]] updated.
- **Semantic-HTML / SEO-markup convention added** — new [[html-semantics]]
  rulebook: landmarks, one `<h1>` + heading outline, native elements over
  `div`s, forms/images/ARIA, JSON-LD over microdata, a `data-*` convention, and
  passing a semantic `tag` to animation components. Codified as AGENTS.md hard
  rule #10; cross-linked from [[component-conventions]] and [[new-page]]. Fixed
  the demo (`home-showcase.tsx`) to a single `<h1>` to follow it.
- **API layer added** — a convention for reaching external services.
  `app/api/<resource>/route.ts` Route Handlers own their logic and read secret
  env vars directly (safe — route files never reach the browser). New: `zod`
  dependency; `src/env.ts` (validated env, public/server split); `src/lib/api/`
  (`handle` wrapper + `ApiError` + `{ data }`/`{ error }` envelope);
  `src/lib/api-client.ts` (typed same-origin fetch); example
  `app/api/contact/route.ts`. Codified as AGENTS.md hard rule #9. See
  [[decisions-log]] ADR-0011 and [[api-architecture]].

## 2026-05-21

- **Asset convention added** — site content assets (images, videos) now live
  under `public/assets/<section>/`, one folder per section; meta/PWA/SEO assets
  stay at the `public/` root. Documented in [[folder-structure]],
  [[component-conventions]], and the [[new-page]] playbook; `public/assets/`
  created with a `.gitkeep`.
- **SEO & performance hardening** — a broad pass on the starter. **SEO:** new
  `src/lib/site.ts` config (single source of truth, fed by `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`);
  `metadataBase` is now always set (relative OG/canonical URLs resolve);
  `themeColor` moved to a `viewport` export; added `app/robots.ts`,
  `app/sitemap.ts`, and an `Organization`+`WebSite` JSON-LD helper; OG image
  dimensions corrected to match the asset; dead `keywords`/`other` tags dropped.
  **Performance:** populated `next.config.ts` (`removeConsole` in prod,
  AVIF/WebP, `next/image` breakpoints aligned to the grid, `poweredByHeader:
  false`); fixed a `requestAnimationFrame` leak in `ScrollLayout` (Lenis loop
  never cancelled on unmount); `HomeView` is now a Server Component with the
  animation demo split into the `HomeShowcase` client leaf; added
  `<ReducedMotion>` (honours `prefers-reduced-motion` via react-spring's global
  `skipAnimation`); removed a per-frame `console.log` from the demo; added
  `app/loading.tsx` / `error.tsx` / `not-found.tsx`. See [[decisions-log]]
  ADR-0010, [[seo-metadata]], and [[environment-variables]].
- **Animation engine — lint pass** — cleared all 13 pre-existing ESLint problems
  in the engine (2 errors + 11 warnings), an authorized engine edit (ADR-0009).
  `isMobileDisabled` now takes an optional `viewportWidth` argument, so the
  `active` memos in `<Spring>` / `<Hover>` / `<Inview>` / the trigger hooks
  depend on it genuinely. Added missing `disableOnMobile` effect deps; fixed a
  `trigger.current`-in-cleanup hazard in `<Hover>`; ref-stabilised `<Handle>`'s
  transition effects. **API change:** `useProgressTrigger` now returns `progress`
  as a `RefObject<number>` (read `.current`) instead of a render-time ref read —
  no consumer was affected (`<ProgressTrigger>` discards the return).
- **Animation engine — performance refactor** — fixed load issues that scaled
  with the number of animated components. Added `src/lib/animation/ticker.ts`, a
  single reference-counted `requestAnimationFrame` loop; `useLoop` (and all loop
  hooks) now subscribe to it instead of each starting its own rAF. `useWindowWidth`
  / `Height` / `Size` now share one debounced `resize` listener via a
  `useSyncExternalStore` store (the `debounceDelay` param was dropped — unused).
  `useDynamicInView` rewritten without the per-render `Proxy`/observer churn.
  Fixed a stale-closure bug in `useLoop`. `mode="forward"` scroll listeners made
  `passive`. This was an **authorized edit to `#do-not-modify` engine files** —
  hard rule #2 amended. See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0009 and [[animation-system]].
- **`spring-text-engine` updated** — bumped `^0.1.3` → `^0.1.5` (latest). The
  public API, types, and dependencies are unchanged between these versions
  (verified) — an internal-only patch bump, no code changes required.
- **Adaptive scaling grid added** — a root-font-size scaling system landed in
  `src/components/common/grid/` (`<AdaptiveGrid>` + `useAdaptiveGrid` hook +
  `grid.config.ts`), with `vw` media queries in `globals.css` for scale-down.
  It was dropped into `common/` as a `styled-components` system; ported to the
  project stack — config-driven TS + CSS-only Tailwind, no `styled-components`.
  The unused dropped files (`colors.ts`, `fonts.ts`, `utils.ts`, `index.ts`,
  the `styled-components` `grid.tsx`) were removed. Mounted via `<AdaptiveGrid>`
  in the root layout. See [[components/common]] and [[decisions-log]] ADR-0008.
- **Vault created** — `obsidian/` Obsidian vault initialised as the project's
  second brain. Architecture, frontend, and workflow docs populated. See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0001.
- **Root README rewritten** — replaced `create-next-app` boilerplate with a real
  project README that points into this vault.
- **`generic-layout-prompt.md` moved** — relocated from repo root to
  `obsidian/workflows/` as [[generic-layout-prompt]].
- **Navigation convention resolved** — standard `next/link` confirmed; the unbuilt
  `<AnimLink>` / `useAnimRouter()` convention dropped. See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0005.
- **Docs consolidated into the vault** — `project-specs.md` deleted (decomposed into
  vault notes + new [[environment-variables]]); `text-engine-docs.md` moved in as
  [[text-engine-reference]]. `AGENTS.md` rewritten as a thin shim; `.cursorrules`
  repointed to `@AGENTS.md`. The vault is now the single source of truth.
  See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0006.
- **Vault renamed & restructured** — vault folder `getlayers.io/` → `obsidian/`;
  number prefixes dropped from section folders (`00-meta` → `meta`, etc.). Project
  name standardised to **`next16-claude-starter`** across docs and `package.json`.
- **Components linked to docs** — every file in `src/components/` now carries a
  `// 📖 Docs:` pointer comment to its catalog note, so agents can jump from code
  to docs and back.
- **Vault workflow automated** — added `.claude/settings.json` with `SessionStart`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop` hooks that make agents read the vault first,
  follow the relevant guide, and update docs after every change — with no manual
  reminder. See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0007 and [[ai-agent-guide]].
- **Cookie component replaced** — the `react-cookie-consent`-based `cookie.tsx`
  was replaced by an in-house `Cookie/` component (banner + category preferences
  modal + Zustand store). `react-cookie-consent` removed from dependencies. The
  component shipped using `styled-components` + an external design system; it was
  ported to the project stack — Tailwind v4 tokens and `@react-spring/web` motion.
  Mounted via `<LazyCookie>`. See [[components/common]].
- **Fixed TextEngine spring type mismatch** — the `mode="once"` heading in
  `views/home.tsx` mixed `lineIn={{ y: 0 }}` (number) with `lineOut={{ y: "100%" }}`
  (string), throwing *"Cannot animate between _AnimatedString and _AnimatedValue"*.
  Changed to `y: "0%"`. The buggy pattern in [[text-engine]] / [[text-engine-reference]]
  examples was corrected and a type-matching gotcha note added.
