# 🧠 next16-claude-starter — Project Brain

This vault is the **single source of truth** for the `next16-claude-starter` project. It documents
how the project is built, why decisions were made, and how to extend it — for both
humans and AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor).

> [!info] What is this project?
> `next16-claude-starter` (package name `next16-claude-starter`) is a **Next.js 16 starter template**
> built by [Textura](https://textura.agency) for animation-heavy marketing & landing
> sites. Every motion is spring-based; there is no backend yet.

## 🔌 Obsidian setup

Open this folder (`obsidian/`) as an Obsidian vault. Recommended:
- **Graph view** — see how specs, components, and hooks connect
- **Dataview plugin** — query notes (e.g. list all `#wip` pages)
- **Templates core plugin** — point it at the `templates/` folder
